# table definition for post 2014 HPMS data

Really Caltrans should keep dumping data in the "old" format, as it matches
the format in the hpms documentation, but in fact they've decided to
dump as shape files with just a tiny number of columns that we
explicitly ask for.  That is what this table is for.

For historical reasons, it is called hpms_2014.

Requires hpms schema sqitch package is already deployed.


# deploy
